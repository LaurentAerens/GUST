# GUST - Genetic Universal Stockfish Trainer

## Vision
GUST aims to be a modular framework for experimenting with chess engines and neural networks. The initial focus is on building a robust base framework for managing chess engine tournaments and simulations. Neural network integration will be introduced in later stages.

## Current Development Focus
1. **Base Framework**:
   - Load and manage chess engines.
   - Simulate matches between engines.
   - Implement a tournament framework with scoring.
2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Generate random moves for testing.
   - Integrate neural networks for position evaluation.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository.
- Follow the `TODO.md` file for the current development tasks.
- Run the base framework to load engines and simulate matches.
