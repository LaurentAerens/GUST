# Todo List

- [ ] Set up project structure
  - Ensure the project structure supports modular development. Include folders for engine handling, tournament framework, and neural network integration.
- [ ] Load engine list
  - Implement functionality to load a list of chess engines with their ELO ratings and executable paths.
- [ ] Simulate engine matches
  - Write code to simulate matches between loaded engines, where engines play against each other.
- [ ] Implement tournament framework
  - Develop a framework to manage tournaments, including match scheduling and result tracking.
- [ ] Implement scoring system
  - Develop a scoring system for tournaments, assigning points based on wins, losses, and draws.
- [ ] Generate random moves
  - Write code to generate all possible moves for a position and pick one randomly.
- [ ] Integrate neural network (future task)
  - Plan and implement neural network integration for evaluating positions.
- [ ] Create CLI for user input
  - Develop a command-line interface to configure engine paths, tournament settings, and other options.
- [ ] Write unit tests for core components
  - Ensure all modules have unit tests to verify functionality.
- [ ] Document MVP progress
  - Update the project plan and README with progress and next steps.
